              <h2>Hello</h2>
              <p>
                My name is Kasper Kain. I'm an aspiring software developer based
                in Orlando Florida and student at Thinkful. I have modest
                experience in developing games and mobile applications as a
                hobby and now strive to expand my skill set to include web
                development as well. I'm proficient at using a wide group of
                tools such as Game Engines and frameworks, Art Programs, DAWS
                and several miscellaneous programming tools. My programming
                languages of choice are C#, Java and JavaScript. I also produce
                digital music, create 3D Models and draw. My ultimate goal in
                life is to make a career out of doing what I already do for fun
                > Solve problems and create things.

            <h1>Where I come from</h1>
            <p>
              I was born and raised along the coast of Alabama. If you're
              thinking trailer parks and churches, You're (sort of) correct!
              Where many would see this as a disadvantage however, I would
              disagree. I come from a line of hard-working and dedicated folks
              who have taught me that anything is achievable with enough blood
              and sweat. I am who I am because of this. My skills and talents
              aren't a product of universities or social pressure, But through
              years of sheer dedication, self-discipline and sacrifice, And that
              is my advantage. I strive to excel at everything I do. Failure
              simply isn't an option. My motto - "Whatever you do, Do it well".
            </p>

            <h1>How I got here</h1>
            <p>
              Creativity and problem solving has always been a core part of my
              nature. Growing up I would spend many days out of any given week
              submerged in some sort of personal project. Rather that be solving
              puzzles, building puzzles, breaking and fixing electronics,
              converting PCs into dedicated arcade machines, or simply taking
              things apart just to see how they work. Fast forward to adulthood
              and I have combined this aspect of my nature with my newfound
              passion for writing and designing software. I am the same as I was
              then, But now with the power to create and manipulate a digital
              world. Programming is my passion and lifestyle. I do what I do not
              for the sake of a paycheck, but because I can't imagine doing
              anything else.
